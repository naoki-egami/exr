Package: exr
Title: Quantifying Robustness to External Validity Bias
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Naoki Egami and Martin Devaux
Maintainer: Naoki Egami <naoki.egami@columbia.edu>
Description: R package exr estimates  a measure of external robustness (ranges from 0 to 1) by estimating how much different populations should be from the experimental sample to explain away the T-PATE. This package provides the central function exr() and companion functions summary() to summarize results and plot() to visualize results. Please read Devaux and Egami (2022+) (https://naokiegami.com/paper/external_robust.pdf).
